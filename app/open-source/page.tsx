              Many educational technology companies have created products that
              seemed promising at first but eventually disappeared, leaving
              schools and students without the tools they depended on.
            </p>

            <p>
              When schools have to keep switching between different tools
              because old ones stop working, it makes teaching harder and wastes
              money and time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Open-source software like Aratuku, which uses the AGPL 3.0
              license, helps solve this problem by making its code freely
              available to everyone.
            </p>

            <p>
              When schools use regular commercial software, they can&apos;t see
              how it actually works or check if it&apos;s keeping student data
              safe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since Aratuku&apos;s code is open for anyone to study, people can
              find and fix security problems quickly, and schools can trust that
              their data is being handled properly.
            </p>

            <p>
              Schools can also modify Aratuku to work exactly the way they need
              it to, instead of having to follow what a company decides is best.
            </p>

            <p>
              By sharing our code openly, we help other people who want to
              create educational software, which leads to more innovation and
              better tools for everyone.
            </p>

            <p>
              This approach of working together means schools can create exactly
              the right tools for their specific teaching needs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Aratuku isn&apos;t just making software â€“ we&apos;re building a
              group of people who care about making education better for
              everyone.
